I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Newcastle, Australia, in conjuction with Ghent University, Belgium.
I have developed a wide array of experience working with high-level athletes and coaches from both Australian and Belgium. I have developed a well-rounded knowledge of R, Matlab and Visual Basic programming languages and have experience with big data management, statistical assessments and various sports science specific software and hardware (e.g. GPS, fusion, etc.). Although I am a very logical thinker, I take pride in being able to bridge the gap between research and practice by communicating complex data in clear and valuable ways using various presentation methods using tools such as Tableau and Shiny.
I have always had a great passion for sports development, whether it be from a coaching or analytical perspective.
